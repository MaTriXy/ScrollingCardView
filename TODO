Before launch:
- Ensure license compatibility (with libs I'm using)
  - Make example use more lenient license?
- Email team
  - naming? no conflicts. Scrollable vs Expanding.
- Readme/repo/file comment cleanup & consistency
- podspec (version)
- Push to Cocoapods (carthage? test!) (version? always ++?)
- Prox to use cocoapods

Later:
- Warn if contentView not set (crash? log?)
- Set requiresConstraintBasedLayout?
- Remaining TODOs in file.
- Tests / samples:
  - contentView changes size from changing intrinsic size
  - modifying contentView after initial set
- Option to animate layout changes?
- Set easy padding inside card view?
- UX: How to show this view is scrollable? What would Material do?
  - Alternatively, make scrollView public so others can handle themselves
